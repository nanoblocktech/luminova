# PHP PAYMENT GATEWAYS 

Easy to use PHP payment gateway library designed for PHP 8 and above.
The primary goal of this library is to facilitate seamless transitions between different payment merchants,
allowing developers to switch gateways without the need for relearning of new implementation and documentation.
Initialization involves specifying the preferred merchant, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience.
Currently, PayStack is the starting point for this library.

```bash
composer require nanoblocktech/payment-gateways
